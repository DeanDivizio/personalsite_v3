# My portfolio site - take 3

First was vanilla React, built to static - not great. Second was Next.JS with a basic design - better. But now I know what I'm doing. Time to really nail it.

## Goals

### Take Out my portrait
I hate it on the home page. image alongside text was a crutch. I can do better.

### Refine type
Montserrat is great but I use it too often. Same with Lato, Raleway, Open-Sans, etc. Use a new type face.

### Color as accent not as significant backgrounds
Every text box on my current site has that frosted colored glass look. Loved it then, can do better now.

### Represent information better
This is particularly pertinent for the Development and Design sections. Image gallery works for photos. 

## End Goal
Smooth, Bold, Modern, Simple

## To do

- [] Home Page Layout and Content
- [] Colors, Type
- [] Main element animations
- [] Background selection and animations
- [] Gallery pages (give more detailed descriptions of previous projects)
